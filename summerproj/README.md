# VERSION 1 OF CODE

Contains everything I have coded up to now (Version 1).

Future changes will be uploaded here.

Current things I plan on adding (VERSION 2)
  - Implement File Dialogs to actually be able to import files into the app
  - Implementation of AQME/RDKIT to help with the following:
  - Make the app be able to read/execute .SDF (and also XYZ, other common molecule formats, mainly .sdf though)
  - Initalise correct layout for both ORCA/GAUSSIAN imput files so that no errors arise when buttons are clicked to generate specific input script 
  - Allow user imput to be read i.e when user clicks the button (GAUSSIAN, app is genuinely aware of this and modifies imput script as needed.
  - Implement file dialogs to allow generated imput file to be exported to a specific directory chosen by the user
  - Tidy up app/make it look nicer
