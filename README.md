Completely removed SMILES FUNCTIONALITY where initially we made new conformers from a file.
- When a .sdf file is inserted, a 3D Molecular viewer opens at the bottom of the screen, allowing each molecule within that file to be selected and viewed accordingly.
- Option to export 10 lowest energy molecules within the file (this does work for the 6k molecule file I tried it, although it does make the app freeze)
- Changed the UI a little bit (added a zoom button to 3D viewer, changed colour scheme)
- Currently the molecular viewer stuff only works for .sdf files, a lil buggy with .xyz so haven't implemented it yet
- All other features haven't really been touched.
