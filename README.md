MOLECULARVIEWER Still does not work on windows 


>[!Important] 
>Possible things to do:

- [X] Ability to upload multiple files at once and treat them all at once
- [ ] Amend the methodology section for both Orca and Gaussian to include more (.xand more relevant) methods
- [X] Find a way to work with XYZ files (and many of them at once)
- [ ] Add unit tests (I hear every software endeavour has them idk we're both amateurs here)
- [ ] *For dealing with multiple files later on* there needs to be a way to automatically assign mult/charge and not impose it to all mols at once
