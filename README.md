# Easychem

EasyChem is a user-friendly desktop application built with PySide6 that simplifies the preparation of computational chemistry calculations for both ORCA and Gaussian software packages. Users can load molecular files for interactive 3D visualization and generate input files with a wide range of calculation methods supported by both software packages. The application enables batch processing of multiple files and provides preview/editing capabilities for generated input files. EasyChem aims to cut down the time spent creating input files and allows for a smoother overall computational chemistry workflow.
