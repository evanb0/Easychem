# summerproj

Not too many updates have been added, but fixed a few issues:
- Molecular viewer now only opens once, rather than the bug where it was opening twice
- The most stable conformer is showed first, however stil a dropdown option of 10 for others to be checked
- I added some sort of axis system (this is not really clean, but I thought it can be used to see if a molecule is planar/symmetric etc)
- Tidied up the UI a little bit.
