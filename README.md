MOLECULARVIEWER Still does not work on windows 


>[!Important] 
>Possible things to do:

- [X] Ability to upload multiple files at once and treat them all at once
      - Button to upload multiple files. For .SDF Files, also an ability to switch between the files and the currently selected file from the list of multiple files will show it's molecules within the 3D viewer.
- [ ] Amend the methodology section for both Orca and Gaussian to include more (.xand more relevant) methods
- [X] Find a way to work with XYZ files (and many of them at once)
      - For this, .xyz files managed to work for the input files however I couldn't actually get them to show within 3D viewer, idk if this is limitations of RDkit being able to pull info for xyz files or I was just missing files.
- [ ] Add unit tests (I hear every software endeavour has them idk we're both amateurs here)
- [ ] *For dealing with multiple files later on* there needs to be a way to automatically assign mult/charge and not impose it to all mols at once
