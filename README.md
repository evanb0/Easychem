Currently working on an issue where although the window view opens for the molecule, the molecule itself does not actually show. This seems to only be an issue on WINDOWS, this does not occur on mac.

Not too many updates have been added, but fixed a few issues:
- Molecular viewer now only opens once, rather than the bug where it was opening twice
- The most stable conformer is showed first, however stil a dropdown option of 10 for others to be checked
- I added some sort of axis system (this is not really clean, but I thought it can be used to see if a molecule is planar/symmetric etc)
- Tidied up the UI a little bit.
